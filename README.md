# API_Documentation
Have you built web APIs in .NET? I am sure setting up the API is hard in itself but adding components that enable you to auto document your API is equally important
# Inspiration
The inspiration of this project comes after the launch of MCP servers(Model Context Protocol). If you want your APIs to readily act as tools for an AI agent you need it to be well documented so that Agents can easily assimilate them in their workflows. I wanted to show all the features available in .NET that makes it easy for developers to generate documentation as they build the service.
# Use of this project
Anyone can use this project as a template if they are building their API from scratch or if you want to see specific documentation strategies there is a list of concepts listed below
use that list and navigate to the specific code snippet inside this project.
